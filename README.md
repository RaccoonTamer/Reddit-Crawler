Reddit Media Downloader 📥

Want to grab images from Reddit without the hassle? This app makes it easy! You can pick a subreddit, set how many posts you want to pull, and let the app do the rest. It’ll download the images you want and even keep things tidy by making sure you don’t get any duplicates. Plus, it tracks useful details for each image, like the post title, author, upvotes, and when it was uploaded.

What It Does:

Metadata at a Glance: 📝 Each image comes with key info like the title, author, upvotes, and posting time.

No Duplicates: 🚫 It remembers which images you've already downloaded, so you won’t get the same ones twice.

Fetches New Content: 🔄 The app pulls in the latest media from a subreddit, using smart requests to avoid hitting Reddit’s API limits. It keeps everything running smoothly, even when you’re pulling a lot of posts.

Easy-to-Use Interface: 🖥️ The simple, clean layout makes navigating a breeze. You can input the subreddit name, choose the number of posts you want, and then see everything in a gallery view to easily browse the images.

NSFW Content: 🔥 This app also lets you download NSFW images by bypassing Reddit's usual filters, so you can access and save content marked as explicit without any issues.

Videos Coming Soon: 🎥 Right now, the app only handles images, but video downloads are on the way in the next update. Stay tuned!

Whether you’re a Reddit fan, a curator, or just want to archive cool images from the site (including NSFW), this app is a perfect solution. Forget about manually saving images one by one—let the app take care of it! 🙌
